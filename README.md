## Installation

### Using pip/pipx

A generic way that works on most 'standard' Linux distributions out of the box.
The following example shows how to install `openconect-sso` along with its
dependencies including Qt:

```shell
$ pip install --user pipx
Successfully installed pipx
$ pipx install "openconnect-sso[full]"
‚£æ installing openconnect-sso
  installed package openconnect-sso 0.4.0, Python 3.7.5
  These apps are now globally available
    - openconnect-sso
‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: '/home/vlaci/.local/bin' is not on your PATH environment variable.
These apps will not be globally accessible until your PATH is updated. Run
`pipx ensurepath` to automatically add it, or manually modify your PATH in your
shell's config file (i.e. ~/.bashrc).
done! ‚ú® üåü ‚ú®
Successfully installed openconnect-sso
$ pipx ensurepath
Success! Added /home/vlaci/.local/bin to the PATH environment variable.
Consider adding shell completions for pipx. Run 'pipx completions' for
instructions.

You likely need to open a new terminal or re-login for the changes to take
effect. ‚ú® üåü ‚ú®
```

If you have Qt 5.x installed, you can skip the installation of bundled Qt version:

``` bash
pipx install openconnect-sso
```

Of course you can also install via `pip` instead of `pipx` if you'd like to
install system-wide or a virtualenv of your choice.

### On Arch Linux

There is an unofficial package available for Arch Linux on
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openconnect-sso/). You can use your
favorite AUR helper to install it:

``` shell
yay -S openconnect-sso
```

### Using nix

The easiest method to try is by installing directly:

```shell
$ nix-env -i -f https://github.com/vlaci/openconnect-sso/archive/master.tar.gz
unpacking 'https://github.com/vlaci/openconnect-sso/archive/master.tar.gz'...
[...]
installing 'openconnect-sso-0.4.0'
these derivations will be built:
  /nix/store/2z47740z1rr2cfqfin5lnq04sq3c5xjg-openconnect-sso-0.4.0.drv
[...]
building '/nix/store/50q496iqf840wi8b95cfmgn07k6y5b59-user-environment.drv'...
created 606 symlinks in user environment
$ openconnect-sso
```

An overlay is also available to use in nix expressions:

``` nix
let
  openconnectOverlay = import "${builtins.fetchTarball https://github.com/vlaci/openconnect-sso/archive/master.tar.gz}/overlay.nix";
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { overlays = [ openconnectOverlay ]; };
in
  #  pkgs.openconnect-sso is available in this context
```

... or to use in `configuration.nix`:

``` nix
{ config, ... }:

{
  nixpkgs.overlays = [
    (import "${builtins.fetchTarball https://github.com/vlaci/openconnect-sso/archive/master.tar.gz}/overlay.nix")
  ];
}
```

### Windows *(EXPERIMENTAL)*

Install with [pip/pipx](#using-pippipx) and be sure that you have `sudo` and `openconnect`
executable commands in your PATH.

## Usage

If you want to save credentials and get them automatically
injected in the web browser:

```shell
$ openconnect-sso --server vpn.server.com/group --user user@domain.com
Password (user@domain.com):
[info     ] Authenticating to VPN endpoint ...
```

User credentials are automatically saved to the users login keyring (if
available).

If you already have Cisco AnyConnect set-up, then `--server` argument is
optional. Also, the last used `--server` address is saved between sessions so
there is no need to always type in the same arguments:

```shell
$ openconnect-sso
[info     ] Authenticating to VPN endpoint ...
```

Configuration is saved in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openconnect-sso/config.toml`. On
typical Linux installations it is located under
`$HOME/.config/openconnect-sso/config.toml`

Example configuration (generated on first run):

```toml
on_disconnect = ""
override_script = ""
authenticate_timeout = 10

[default_profile]
address = ""
user_group = ""
name = ""

[credentials]
username = ""

[auto_fill_rules]
[[auto_fill_rules."https://*"]]
selector = "div[id=passwordError]"
action = "stop"

[[auto_fill_rules."https://*"]]
selector = "input[type=email]"
fill = "username"

[[auto_fill_rules."https://*"]]
selector = "input[type=password]"
fill = "password"

[[auto_fill_rules."https://*"]]
selector = "input[type=submit]"
action = "click"
```

## Custom SSO script

openconnect-sso uses [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) to interface with the browser in order to automate entering the credentials required to achieve an access token for connecting with `openconnect`.

If the `auto_fill_rules` in the _config.toml_ file do not meet the needs of your usage, the path to a custom javascript userscript can be passed via the argument `--override-script` or in the configuration by specifying a value for `override_script`.

This file is expanded with environment variables including `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` to enable the same script to be applied across unique logins.

An example of the a script is located at [example/defaultRules.js](./example/defaultRules.js). This example is the same script that is executed with the default `auto_fill_rules`.

## Headless-Mode

Headless usage can be specified using the argument `--browser-display-mode=hidden`. In this mode, the browser will not be displayed while the script interacts with the SSO provider. This mode can also be used to enable support for containerized environments

### Debugging Headless Execution

When running in headless mode, any failures in attempting to authenticate in the browser will attempt to be captured in a screenshot which will be saved to the current working directory.


## Development

`openconnect-sso` is developed using [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/). Refer to the
[Quick Start section of the Nix
manual](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-quick-start) to see how to get it
installed on your machine.

To get dropped into a development environment, just type `nix-shell`:

```shell
$ nix-shell
Sourcing python-catch-conflicts-hook.sh
Sourcing python-remove-bin-bytecode-hook.sh
Sourcing pip-build-hook
Using pipBuildPhase
Sourcing pip-install-hook
Using pipInstallPhase
Sourcing python-imports-check-hook.sh
Using pythonImportsCheckPhase
Run 'make help' for available commands

[nix-shell]$
```

To try an installed version of the package, issue `nix-build`:

```shell
$ nix build
[1 built, 0.0 MiB DL]

$ result/bin/openconnect-sso --help
```

Alternatively you may just [get Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and
start developing by using the included `Makefile`. Type `make help` to see the
possible make targets.
